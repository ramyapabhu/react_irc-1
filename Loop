/*LOOP:

  1. for Loop:
The for loop is used when you know in advance how many times the loop should run.*/
// Print numbers 1 to 5 using a for loop
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
/* 2.While loop

2. while Loop:
The while loop continues to execute a block of code as long as the specified condition is true.*/
 // Print numbers 1 to 5 using a while loop
let i = 1;
while (i <= 5) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}
/*3. do-while Loop:
Similar to the while loop, the do-while loop also executes a block of code as long as the specified condition is true. The difference is that the do-while loop always executes the block of code at least once before checking the condition.*/

// Print numbers 1 to 5 using a do-while loop
let i = 1;
do {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
} while (i <= 5);
